Hand Written Digit Recognition Deep learning Project in Python with Google Colab deployed as a Web Application.

Machine learning concepts like data cleansing, data analysis, split dataset in to train and test datasets, creating a machine learning model, training machine learning model and predicting values from Machine learning model and finally deploying machine learning model as web Application in real time.

This Deep learning project built with TensorFlow Model, Keras Layers and Mnist Dataset and deployed it as a Web Application.
